# Movie-Sync

A simple nodejs server that hosts a video that all clients see and sync playback with. Useful for a watch party. Works on any platform with a webbrowser supporting video element and js.

# How to use

1. clone repository
2. in main folder `npm i`
3. `node server.js`
4. open `http://localhost:3000`, use your server ip instead of localhost (check firewall for NAT forwarding for global IP hosting) if you're trying to reach the server over LAN or WAN.
